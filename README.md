## Game Objective

Suika Game, the inspiration behind Shiny Octo Potato, was a viral sensation in Japan known for its simple yet addictive gameplay. The objective is to drop fruit onto a board, aiming to get matching fruits to touch and fuse into a bigger fruit, granting extra points.

The game ends when the board fills up, pushing you to beat your high score in the next attempt.
